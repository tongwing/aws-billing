This is the requirement for a web app to track cloud usage:
- use a config file to store AWS access key/secret key
- retrieve the last 30 days (or user-defined duration) of cost and usage
- produce a real-time dashboard using 1.png as a reference
- allow user to group by different dimensions, eg. by linked account, service
- allow user to enable different charge types (eg. bundled discount, out-of-cycle charges, etc)
- include any other filters you think is suitable
